# DHCP
This contains the  way and the procedure on how a DHCP protocol will operate in our casual day to day lives...
Dynamic host configuration protool or DHCP in short is used assign an ip address to a device that gets connected to a netwok dynamically without any adjustments or configurations that is needed to be done from the User side (Static).
With this it becomes much more easier to deal with the network and any issue that may come across can be corrected with relatively lesser time required..
